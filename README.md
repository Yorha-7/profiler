# Profiler:
 profiler is a open sourced cmake build to implement the source code library <profiler.hpp>
 this gives you the execution time and memory used stats on the terminal after code finished its runtime, could be very great to use after some more upgrades.
 ## Example usage:
 ```cpp
 #include<profiler.hpp>

 int main(){
   Profiler p;  // create an object to initiate the construction of object and be implemented.
   //your main code here
}
```
after this sit back and relax, once code finished execution it will give you the details that can help you to think of new algorithm and improve, i was planning to add a graph that would show the time complexity and space complexity on 
diffrent input we use but i have no clue hoe to save one such graph.
